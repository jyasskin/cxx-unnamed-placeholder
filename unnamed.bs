# Introduction and motivation # {#intro}

We have several locations in C++ where a name is expected, but programmers may
not need to use that name ever again. Right now, they have to pick a different
name for each location, and readers can't immediately tell that the name isn't
used without an attribute or a naming convention. It would be nice to have a
clear, enforceable way to state that a name is ignored.

To enforce that the name is actually ignored, and that people reading the code
don't think that an unused variable is actually used, using it in an expression
should be an error instead of having a tag type like `nullptr_t`.

# Examples # {#examples}

The goal of this section is to provide an example of using the placeholder in
all declaration contexts where it makes sense. These examples use `__` as the
placeholder, but see [[#spelling]] for an analysis of several options.

## Variables ## {#ex-variables}

To lock a mutex for a scope, without worrying that the variable name is already
taken:

```c++
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> __(a_mutex);
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> __(a_second_mutex);
```

To hold some data alive that's used via internal pointers:

```c++
std::unique_ptr<T> ptr = ...;
[__=std::move(ptr), &field1=ptr->field1, &field2=ptr->field2](){...};
```

Note that the lambda capture case syntactically allows `[&__=init, ...](){}`, but
this is probably not useful.

## Speculative: Concept-constrained declarations ## {#ex-concept}

To define a deduced-type non-type template parameter where the type matches a
concept but the type isn't given a name in the body of the class or function:

```c++
template<Integral __ N> class integral_constant { ... };
```

To declare a deduced-type parameter or local variable whose type is constrained
by a concept:

```c++
Numeric multiplyAdd(Numeric __ x, Numeric __ y, Numeric __ z) {
  Numeric __ multiplied = x * y;
  return multiplied + z;
}
```

## Structured Bindings ## {#ex-structured-binding}

[[P0144R2]] §3.8 mentions that structured bindings could potentially use a
syntax to ignore some fields from a bound structure:

> ```c++
> tuple<T1,T2,T3> f();
> auto [x, std::ignore, z] = f(); // NOT proposed: ignore second element
> ```

[[P0144R2]] suggests waiting until a pattern matching proposal, at which point
the right token will fall out. I suggest that this proposal also provides a
reasonable token, making this:

```c++
tuple<T1,T2,T3> f();
auto [x, __, z] = f(); // Ignore second element.
```

## Enumerators ## {#ex-enumerator}

This makes it very slightly easier to skip a value:

```c++
enum MmapBits {
  Shared,
  Private,
  __,
  __,
  Fixed,
  Rename,
  ...
};
```

I suspect that this is less clear than explicitly assigning the values, so it
would make sense to not support this.

## Less useful examples ## {#less-useful-ex}

### Using ### {#ex-using}

To use a type name, without being able to use the alias. I think using a type
name has side-effects, so there's probably not much point.

```c++
using __ = typename Base::value_type;
```

Similarly non-useful:

```c++
typedef typename Base::value_type __;
namespace __ = std::ranges;
```

### Concept introduction ### {#ex-concept-intro}

Like name aliases, a `requires` clause doesn't have side-effects, so doesn't
need to be assigned to an unnamed concept.

```c++
concept __ = requires {...};
```

### Class, Struct, Enum, Namespace ### {#ex-class}

These aren't useful because developers can simply omit the name:

```c++
class __ : Base { ... };
struct __ : Base { ... };
namespace __ { ... };
enum __ { Enumerator };
```

### Unnamed parameters ### {#ex-unnamed-param}

Like unused class names, parameter names can simply be omitted instead of
needing a placeholder.

```c++
class C : public Base {
  void Func(int i, long __) override;
};

template<typename __>
class UsedInTemplateTemplateParam { ... };
```

# Prior Art # {#prior}

## Haskell ## {#prior-haskell}

Haskell uses a `_` token to indicate unused things:

```haskell
head (x:_)  = x
tail (_:xs) = xs
```

Note that the _ can be "initialized" multiple times, unlike a named but unused
variable:

```haskell
data Colour = Colour { red::Int, green::Int, blue::Int, opacity::Int}

isOpaqueColour :: Colour -> Bool
isOpaqueColour (Colour _ _ _ opacity) = opacity == 255
```

## Java ## {#prior-java}

Java uses a `?` token to represent a "wildcard" generic argument.

```java
void printCollection(Collection<?> c) {
    for (Object e : c) {
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

Java generic arguments usually need to be declared, but wildcards imply that a
function is generic:

```java
class Collections {
    public static <T, S extends T> void copy(List<T> dest, List<S> src) {
    ...
}

class Collections {
    public static <T> void copy(List<T> dest, List<? extends T> src) {
    ...
}
```

## Googlemock ## {#prior-googlemock}

Googlemock defines
[`_`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/CheatSheet.md#wildcard)
to match anything. It doesn't use it for declarations, but it's still an "ignore
this" token.

```c++
// Expects the turtle to move forward by 100 units.
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));

// Expects the turtle to move forward.
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(_));
```

# Spelling # {#spelling}

How should we spell the token?

## `_` ## {#spell-underscore}

I believe `_` is the ideal spelling, but [**lex.name**] ¶3.2 only reserves it in
the global namespace, and it's now used by libraries:

* [`testing::_` in
    Googlemock](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/CheatSheet.md#wildcard)
* [The `_()` macro in Gnu
    Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Mark-Keywords.html)

## `__` ## {#spell-double-under}

This is already a reserved identifier per [**lex.name**] ¶3.1.

> Each identifier that contains a double underscore `__` or begins with an
> underscore followed by an uppercase letter is reserved to the implementation
> for any use.

It takes a little longer to type than `_`, and in many fonts the difference
between `__` and `_` may be unclear.

This paper uses `__` in the [examples](#examples).

The `__` identifier is use in some codebases, such as [the V8 JavaScript engine]https://github.com/v8/v8/search?q=%22define+__%22&unscoped_q=%22define+__%22_).

## `?` ## {#spell-question}

`?` might be confusable with the ternary `?:` operator, but developers can
distinguish based on it appearing in a declaration rather than expression
context.

`?` may also be confused with a wildcard like `*`, to mean "union all the
possible values in this position", for example in a `nested::name::specifier`.
Fortunately, I don't see a reason for `?` to be valid in contexts where that
interpretation is plausible.

Using `?` for the placeholder identifier might prevent its use in the syntax for
a forwarding reference. e.g. `ForwardingRef&&?`.

## Repeated `?` ## {#spell-rep-question}

Multiple `?` could be used to disambiguate some of the issues with a single `?`.
Using `??` or `???` is more typing but is fairly obvious, though it would likely
be better to make this a token so whitespace cannot be used between question marks.

## `auto` ## {#spell-auto}

The "attribute" proposal for concept declarations uses `auto` in a place a type
might appear, which one might consider precedent for using it as a more general
placeholder.

## Various Unicode characters ## {#💩}

We could use various Unicode characters, such as the replacement character
`�`, the empty set `∅`, the interrobang `‽`, a trash can `🗑`, one of the
recycle signs `♻️`, and countless other characters.
These all have the shortcoming that not all toolchains and editors support
them well or uniformely.

# Wording # {#wording}

TBD

# Acknowledgements # {#ack}

Daveed Vandevorde suggested using `?`. Thomas Köppe suggested `auto`.
